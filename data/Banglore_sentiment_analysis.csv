Most get way too pessimistic, and the resulting sky is falling syndrome soon ensues, with copious lamenting/anger with rash decisions soon following. This is the 3rd or 4th cycle of this for me, and in reality, it is just noise. If these moves cause you to be become too ebullient or distraught then A: you have too much invested in SOFI, B: are simply watching the price too closely (IE gambling addiction) or C: options are taking control of your investments. The leverage that goes with them is a dangerous choice with a volatile stock like SOFI, unless you can make quick rational decisions to admit you were wrong and quickly exit your position. Good Luck to all.",NEGATIVE,0.998129665851593

Army Boys Sports Company to hold selection trials for sports cadet in Banglore - 2023-12-15T13:27:00Z,"SoFi Daily Chat - January 03, 2024"," KBW's argument suggests that SoFi might initially lose money if interest rates decrease significantly. This is because they'll have to lower the coupon rates on personal loans. However, they are expected to benefit eventually from the lower cost of capital. I believe this is a weak argument. SoFi has a substantial portfolio of loans on their balance sheet that they can sell, which will likely increase in value as rates drop (similar to how high-interest bonds gain value when bond yields fall). Additional, student loan refinancing tends to rise as interest rates decrease. In any case, SoFi should be fine. At most, the article argues for a potential initial pullback with long-term benefits.

How does lowering rates make our loans held for resale less valuable? Wasn't the argument being made previously that with higher rates are loans would not be able to be sold for what we were marking them at?

""SoFi shares have rallied along with other equities on the notion that the Federal Reserve may begin cutting rates this year. But looking at the larger picture, this could actually weigh on earnings, thanks to the company's fair value accounting, analysts explained.

Here's the gist: SoFI sells off the loans it generates to other companies. It has marked up the value of the loans on its book to include the expected future resale price, interest, and fees, as Barron's reported last year . That can be risky when borrowing costs start to fall, KBW argued.

The team estimates that every quarter-point reduction to SoFi's fair-value mark for its held-for-sale loan portfolio equates directly to a $50 million drag on revenue, or five cents of earnings per share.""",NEGATIVE,0.9740204811096191
